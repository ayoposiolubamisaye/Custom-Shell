A simple shell implementation in C that follows POSIX guidelines.
Hope you enjoyed, I created mini functions at first to get a sense for how the shell programs work. This sparked my interested in security :)

Then use ./shell to run

# Features
Shell functions and executing commands.
Input and output redirection using < and >.
Proper error handling.
